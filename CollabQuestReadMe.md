# CollabQuest
Where Ideas Come Together 

## Motivation 
Our group noticed a need for websites like CollabQuest within college life. We want to make group projects an efficient and fun process where everybody can contribute. CollabQuest creates a space for sharing and developing ideas.

## Code Style
The languages used are html, CSS, JS, and PHP. All of the html pages were created as PHP files, as this allowed us to include PHP code directly into the html. Each database feature was made in a separate file and connected back to its page, and each section had its own CSS file as well. We used a bootstrap template as a starting point for the creation of the home page.

## Tech/Framework Used 
XAMPP, which includes: Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for the PHP and Perl programming languages, was used to initially create the web site/server locally and to test the databases. The dynamic hosting site infinityfree was then used to host the data and site. For the landing page, we used the Bootstrap framework as a starting point. We believed this template could be manipulated to represent our idea. 

## Features 
The current features implemented are a basic account system and the ability to create and browse posts of different projects. 

## How To Use
The user accesses the website through a browser. From there, they create an account or log into their exsting account. Within their account, users can browse projects posted on the website from other users. They can also upload their own project and provide a description of what the project consists of. CollabQuest creates a space for an extensive digital library of different projects.
